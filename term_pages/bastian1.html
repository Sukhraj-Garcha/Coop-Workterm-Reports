                <p class="content-text">
                  Bastian Solutions is a Toyota Advanced Logistics company that specializes in material handling, robotics integration, and 
                  providing automated solutions for distribution, manufacturing, and order fulfillment centers around the world. Bastian 
                  provides automation solutions in the following areas: conveyor/sortation, goods to person, automated storage and retrieval 
                  systems (ASRS), picking, and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The company has too many automated solutions to go into detail 
                  about each item here, but you can explore all of their projects <a href="https://www.bastiansolutions.com/" target="blank">here</a>. The bread and 
                  butter of Bastian’s automated solutions is their software known as Exacta. Exacta is broken into three main components: ExactaWCS, ExactaWMS, ExactaWES. 
                  ExactaWCS is the warehouse control system that facilitates material and information flow to order fulfillment technology and material handling 
                  equipment. ExactaWMS is a warehouse management system that tracks inventory, inbound and outbound traffic, and allows customers to customize 
                  and view their warehouse in ways that best benefit their requirements. ExactaWES is the warehouse execution system, which is a combination 
                  of WCS and MCS. In 1952, Elgan Stark founded the company that would eventually become Bastian Solutions (then known as E.C Stark Co. Inc. 
                  At this point, the company supplied conventional material handling products. In 1971, the company was renamed to Bastian Handling Corporation. 
                  In 1980, the company shifted their focus to become more involved with automated solutions and information systems that control the flow of 
                  products in warehouses and manufacturing facilities. Between the years of 2005 and 2012, four major changes occurred: Bastian created its 
                  first robotics division, the company started manufacturing its own line of conveyor, more offices opened up around the world 
                  (Toronto, Montreal, Atlanta, etc.), and began operation under the new name Bastian Solutions. The final major change to the company occurred 
                  in 2017 when Bastian Solutions was acquired by Toyota Advanced Logistics. Currently, Bastian Solutions has offices spread throughout Canada, 
                  the United States, and Mexico and operates with the main goal of providing clients a competitive advantage by designing and delivering world-
                  class distribution and production solutions.

                <h3>Job Description</h3>
                <p class="content-text">
                    At Bastian Solutions, I was a member of Team Bluejay, a fully remote team working on a project titled “Project Sapphire.” 
                    Bluejay was a very small team (only 5 other members, bringing the total to 6 including me) which ended up working in my favour 
                    because it meant that I was given important tasks that directly benefited the project. I joined the team at a very early stage in 
                    the project life cycle. When I first started working at Bastian in September, the team was in the process of getting a minimum 
                    viable product (MVP) together to prove that the product would be useful for Bastian. I believe that I am not allowed to go into too 
                    much detail about the project for confidentiality reasons, but essentially, Project Sapphire is an emulation engine that models the 
                    flow of materials through warehouses. 
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    As a software engineer for Team Bluejay, I was given the opportunity to work on multiple different aspects of software 
                    development. This included testing, backend, frontend, design, and code reviews. I was also introduced to many new tools and 
                    technologies that I was able to get comfortable with using over the last four months. The majority of my work was done in C# 
                    using the .Net framework and Visual Studio as my primary code editor. 
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    Like I said before, I worked on many different tasks throughout the term. During the MVP stage of the project, I spent some 
                    time building out unit tests for the project code through XUnit. This allowed me to become more familiar with the code and 
                    really helped my understanding of the code base. I also did some work on the front-end web app GUI. This was done through 
                    Blazor and C#. I had never heard of Blazor before this term, but after getting the chance to use it, I can definitely see its 
                    value.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    Once the MVP was complete, the team shifted to a complete rebuild and redesign of the discrete emulation engine (DES). At this 
                    point, I was tasked with designing and building out a class hierarchy that allowed us to model the loads that would be moving 
                    through the warehouses. This was a task that would be a part of the foundation of the entire system, so I was very thankful to 
                    be trusted with it. There are a lot of different parts that makeup this “load” object, so a lot of thought had to be put into 
                    the design. After the design was complete and approved, I implemented the class hierarchy in C# and implemented more unit tests 
                    using XUnit. This task gave me direct exposure to the entire implementation process of a new feature and gave me experience with 
                    designing code in such a way that it fits into an already existing system.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    Near the end of the term, I shifted my focus to three main tasks: implementing a metrics gathering system, laying out the 
                    facilities that we were modeling in YAML configuration files, and implementing the PLC logic for the different parts of the 
                    facility. In terms of the metrics, I was responsible for designing a system that allowed us to track different statistics 
                    about loads as they move through the warehouse. This task allowed me to learn many new concepts as well as improve my existing 
                    skills. Specifically, I was able to get an understanding of how events work in C#, and how to trigger certain stuff to happen 
                    based off of when other events occur. Additionally, I gained experience with using local databases because I had to utilize 
                    LiteDB in order to store the metrics information that was gathered locally. Also, implementing the metrics system allowed me to 
                    get a better understanding of asynchronous programming since the handling of the metrics had to be completely asynchronous so 
                    that it didn’t affect the performance of the actual emulation. In terms of the YAML configuration files, they turned out to be 
                    a much greater challenge than I had expected. At first, one would think that this is a fairly easy task, however, as the pieces 
                    that we were trying to build got more complex, I (along with my team members) had to get more creative with our design in order 
                    to layout the facility in a way that models the real life version accurately. This task definitely improved my creative thinking 
                    and designing ability because I had to spend time discussing and thinking about how we would lay out more complex parts of a 
                    facility (like AGVs and ASRS for example). My third main focus, implementing PLC logic, was the most challenging task, but I found 
                    it a very cool and interesting one nonetheless. I was responsible for implementing the logic in the PLCs that reflect how they work
                    in the real facility. This meant making sure that loads were correctly scanned at the different scanners, ensuring that pieces of 
                    conveyor correctly stopped/started when they needed to, and controlling where the load went to next (since in a lot of cases, 
                    there were multiple places where a load could end up). Having the opportunity to work on this side of the project really helped in 
                    my understanding of how our DES engine actually works and how PLCs function in the real world.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    Overall, my four month term here allowed me to complete a variety of different tasks. Some of these allowed me directly 
                    leverage the skills that I learned in class (general coding habits, polymorphism, inheritance, and unit testing to name a few), 
                    while other tasks forced me to do some research online and develop new skills since they were not touched on classes 
                    (YAML configuration files and Blazor front end work for example).

                      <h5>CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING - Inquiry and Analysis</h5>
                      My first goal for this work term was to spend no more than 4-5 weeks to understand the code base of the project. 
                      Being able to read and understand code written by other people is a very important skill for a software developer to have, 
                      so I knew that being able to effectively do so will improve my employability for future opportunities. This particular 
                      goal ended up being more difficult than I first anticipated. First of all, this was my first time coming into a project 
                      that had lots of code that had already been written by other people. Of course, it is much more difficult to understand 
                      other peoples' code than your own, so I actually found this fairly difficult at the start to accomplish. Additionally, I 
                      joined the team at a very interesting time. During the first month of my term, the team was in the process of creating a 
                      minimal viable product (MVP), and this is the code that I was trying to understand, which I think I was successful 
                      in doing after about a month. However, after the MVP was presented and approved, the team shifted to a completely new 
                      engine, and much of the code that I had begun to understand changed completely. Thus, I had to start the learning process 
                      all over again. By the end, I was able to understand a majority of the code base, so in that respect, I believe that I 
                      accomplished my goal. However, the code was constantly changing (seemingly every single day) so I had to constantly adjust 
                      and spend time re-learning the source code.

                   <li>
                    <h5>LITERACY - Technological Literacy </h5>
                    My second goal for the work term was to become comfortable with writing in C#. C# is a popular language, so I knew that 
                    becoming proficient in it would enlarge the pool of jobs that I am a good candidate for. Also, it doesn’t hurt to add another 
                    language to the set of languages that I already know. At this point (at the end of my work term), I can say with confidence 
                    that I have accomplished this goal. During the first few weeks of the term, I had to constantly bring up C# documentation so 
                    that I could look at syntax/usage of very simple things (as expected). However, after working in C# for about 4 months, I no 
                    longer need to constantly rely on documentation and online resources, but instead am able to code with confidence.

                    <h5>PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Personal Organization/Time Management </h5>
                    Another one of my goals for the work term was to successfully manage my time in order to complete all of my required work 
                    within the sprint deadline. My team at Bastian worked in 1-2 week sprints. I recognized that successfully being able to 
                    complete my work in such a fast-paced environment would improve my ability to get work done under pressure and would directly 
                    prepare me to deal with both school and work related deadlines. This goal proved to be a very challenging one. At the start of 
                    the work term, while I was in the process of easing into my work, it was not very hard because the amount of work I was given 
                    was not too heavy and was easily manageable in the sprint period. However, as I got more involved in the project, my workload 
                    increased and deadlines became tighter. The team needed to complete work at an intense pace, so I had to work very hard in 
                    order to prioritize my tasks and finish them in the given amount of time. Although it was difficult, I can say with certainty 
                    that I was successful because I never needed to ask for more time to complete tasks that were assigned to me. Overall, my time 
                    management skills and ability to work under pressure have improved drastically.

                  <h5>CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving</h5>
                    My last goal for this work term was to improve my problem solving skills in terms of programming to the point where I am 
                    able to resolve at least 80-85% of my issues on my own. Running into errors with code is something that is always going to 
                    happen. The ability to debug the code and fix those errors is a crucial skill for a developer to have and is something that 
                    can be constantly improved. I determined that improving this aspect of my development would allow me to finish my assigned 
                    tasks much faster (since I would be spending less time debugging) and will also make me a better developer for future work 
                    opportunities. This particular goal was also a very interesting one. Due to the fact that the majority of the work I was 
                    doing was on topics that were fairly foreign to me, I needed to ask my teammates a fair amount. I don't think I was successful 
                    in completing my original goal of solving 85% of my issues on my own. However I would estimate that around 70-75% of issues 
                    I was able to solve by myself. This term really emphasized the importance of reaching out for help when you need it. 
                    While it is good to be able to solve problems on your own, I think that it is also important to find the right balance 
                    between asking for help and relying on yourself. There is no point in spending hours trying to solve a problem by yourself 
                    when you know that a team member can help you resolve it in a few minutes. Overall, working towards this goal throughout the 
                    term has improved both my ability to solve problems on my own, but also my ability to understand when I should reach out for
                    help.

                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p class="content-text">
                    I could not have asked for a better second work-term experience, Bastian gave me the chance to improve my development skills, 
                    while allowing me to work alongside some amazing people! One interesting aspect of the term that I think is sort of rare to 
                    experience as a co-op student was the fact that I got to ride the wave with the team and see our DES engine come together with 
                    my own eyes. Like I said, when I first joined, the team was in an MVP stage where we had a working engine, but it was very 
                    bare-bones. Then we shifted to a completely new system, and I saw the engine improve drastically. Finally, in my last month, 
                    the team was given their first project to emulate a facility for another company in order to help them visualize what is going wrong 
                    in their facility. Thus, it was very cool to see the project go from something very basic to a proper and useful emulation 
                    tool. To say I learned a lot at Bastian Solutions would be a huge understatement. Although this term was only for four months, 
                    the knowledge and skills that I have gained reflect that of an eight month term and I am very grateful to have had the chance 
                    to work at such an amazing company.

                  Finally, a huge thank you to my supervisor, Samuel Oosterhuis for always being availble when I needed help. Hopping into 
                  debugging sessions on Teams with him greatly improved my understanding of how certain aspects of the source code worked and also 
                  improved my development skills as a whole!
