                <p class="content-text">
                  For 40 years, Camis Inc. has been providing reservations and park management solutions for government operated parks, marinas and harbours. 
                  The founder of the company, Doug Hall, saw the need for an improved reservation system at a campground that he often visited and decided 
                  to provide the solution himself. In 1980, Camis (then known as Bluewater Parklands Management) began operation with just 8 seasonal 
                  employees and Doug Hall. 7 Years later, in 1987, Bluewater Parklands Management was officially registered as a company under the name 
                  Camis and secured contracts with Craigleith, Point Farms & Sauble Falls, Ontario. Throughout the past four decades, the Camis product has 
                  undergone many adaptations, from phone calls to lists on paper to the feature-rich software that is available today. Currently, Camis has 
                  297 employees and has partnered with over 450 government operated facilities in the United States and Canada. With new features being 
                  brainstormed and introduced frequently, it is clear that the Camis software will continue to grow and provide convenience to make camping 
                  a better experience for both campers and campground workers.

                <h3>Job Description</h3>
                <p class="content-text">
                  As a member of the Quality Assurance team in Product Delivery, the majority of my tasks revolved around ensuring that the Camis 
                  software worked as desired and would be able to provide its users with a simple user experience that fulfilled its purpose. 
                  I was directly responsible for checking all aspects of the software to ensure that no bugs were present in a UAT environment 
                  before it was deployed to production. 
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                  The interesting part about this term is that the work that I was working on was not stuff that I have really learned about 
                  (at least thus far) in my education. My day-to-day responsibilities involved completing manual regression testing for specific 
                  releases, manually verifying tickets that have been fixed, verifying UAT feedback tickets provided by clients, creating bug 
                  tickets to report issues found during testing, and updating existing test cycles to account for new/updated features. All of 
                  these are topics that are not really discussed much in class, so it gave me the opportunity to learn new things almost on a 
                  weekly basis since I was exposed to a lot of different tasks and methods of testing.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                  These past 4 months provided a great challenge because I pretty much had to learn new things on the go. 
                  The majority of my work was done using the Jira platform, a platform that I had zero experience with and barely even knew 
                  what it was about prior to this term. Needless to say, I was definitely slightly overwhelmed with all of the different 
                  options/functions that Jira had at first. However, after 4 months of using the platform everyday, I can safely say that I am an 
                  expert. This work term also gave me the challenging opportunity of working in a fast-paced environment with strict deadlines. 
                  The new releases for 3 or 4 clients at a time had to be completely tested, with all concerning issues reported only in a few 
                  days so that they could be deployed to production on time. This type of environment gave me the opportunity to greatly improve
                  my time-management skills. Although the combination of working in such a fast-paced environment for the first time and having to 
                  learn new technologies and skills was scary at first, by the end of the term, I was able to overcome it all and come out as a much
                  stronger individual.

                 <ul class="goals">
                   <li>
                      <h5>LITERACY - Technological Literacy</h5>
                      My first goal for my work term was to get comfortable with using the Jira platform 
                      for all of its different bug tracking and project management features. Jira is a commonly used 
                      platform in software companies and I knew that learning how to use it proficiently will improve my employability 
                      in the field. I was able to complete my goal and throughout my term, I was  exposed to the many different aspects of the 
                      Jira platform (test cycles page, editing existing test cycles, creating a new test cycle for a specific feature, ticket creation, 
                      client release ticket management, and client feedback tickets). When I first started, Jira looked foreign to me and I was overwhelmed by 
                      all of the different options there were. However, after using Jira every day on the job, I am comfortable with navigating the platform and 
                      using it effectively for its different purposes.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <h5>LITERACY - Technological Literacy </h5>
                    My second goal for the work term was to learn how to perform automated testing through writing scripts. 
                    Testing is a very important aspect of creating software, so learning how to do it effectively is a very important step 
                    in my goal to create a career in the development industry. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete this goal because after 
                    discussion with my supervisor, we determined that this goal will not be possible to complete as it is outside the scope of my specific team.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    <h5>PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Teamwork </h5>
                    Another one of my goals for my placement at Camis was to gain a strong understanding of  what it means to work in an Agile Work 
                    Environment and improve my ability to work in a team in an actual work setting. A large majority of modern software companies follow the 
                    pillars of an Agile Work Environment. Learning about what this means and how to be effective in such an environment will greatly improve 
                    my ability to integrate with the team and be a productive member of the organization in future employment opportunities. After working with 
                    an Agile team for 4 months, I can say with confidence that I have a much stronger understanding of what it means to work in an Agile Work 
                    Environment. This work term has allowed me to actually experience what it means to work in a large Agile team (instead of working in a 
                    small team for a group project in school). Camis has many different squads who are all in charge of a very specific aspect of the Camis 
                    software (sales squad, booking squad, QA, etc.). Throughout my time at Camis, I have seen how all of these squads work together and communicate through 
                    Slack/meetings to complete their goals for the current sprint. I have had to pose questions to people from almost every squad in order to achieve my goals, 
                    thus giving me a strong understanding of how an Agile team, despite having smaller teams that focus on a particular thing, are able to work and communicate together to deliver an end product.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  <h5>PERSONAL LEARNING GOAL</h5>
                  A personal learning goal that I wanted to achieve for myself was to develop a closer bond with my teammates, beyond just 
                  simply being co-workers. This goal will not necessarily help my career beyond expanding my network, but this is just something 
                  that I wanted to accomplish over the course of the term just for me. After my time with the QA team, I can say with certainty that 
                  my bond with some of my team members has gone beyond that of co-workers. Everyday, I join stand-up a few minutes early to have 
                  personal conversations with my team members. I have found that this not only improves our friendship, but that it is also a nice 
                  break (especially in a virtual environment) from work related tasks. Additionally, I frequently engage in non-work related 
                  conversations in Slack and have also started to play video games outside of work hours with some of my co-workers.

                  <p class="content-text">
                    Overall, I could not have asked for a better first work term experience. Camis is a wonderful company and gave me the chance to meet and work with 
                    amazing people! I was able to complete challenging (but rewarding) work and gained many valuable skills that will help my employability in the future.
                    Quality Assurance is not typically touched on in class, and before this term, this field of computer science was something that I did not think much 
                    about. However, the last 4 months have taught me just how important the QA role is in running a successful company.
