                  Bastian Solutions is a Toyota Advanced Logistics company that specializes in material handling, robotics integration, and 
                  providing automated solutions for distribution, manufacturing, and order fulfillment centers around the world. Bastian 
                  provides automation solutions in the following areas: conveyor/sortation, goods to person, automated storage and retrieval 
                  systems (ASRS), picking, and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The company has too many automated solutions to go into detail 
                  about each item here, but you can explore all of their projects <a href="https://www.bastiansolutions.com/" target="blank">here</a>. The bread and 
                  butter of Bastianâ€™s automated solutions is their software known as Exacta. Exacta is broken into three main components: ExactaWCS, ExactaWMS, ExactaWES. 
                  ExactaWCS is the warehouse control system that facilitates material and information flow to order fulfillment technology and material handling 
                  equipment. ExactaWMS is a warehouse management system that tracks inventory, inbound and outbound traffic, and allows customers to customize 
                  and view their warehouse in ways that best benefit their requirements. ExactaWES is the warehouse execution system, which is a combination 
                  of WCS and MCS. In 1952, Elgan Stark founded the company that would eventually become Bastian Solutions (then known as E.C Stark Co. Inc. 
                  At this point, the company supplied conventional material handling products. In 1971, the company was renamed to Bastian Handling Corporation. 
                  In 1980, the company shifted their focus to become more involved with automated solutions and information systems that control the flow of 
                  products in warehouses and manufacturing facilities. Between the years of 2005 and 2012, four major changes occurred: Bastian created its 
                  first robotics division, the company started manufacturing its own line of conveyor, more offices opened up around the world 
                  (Toronto, Montreal, Atlanta, etc.), and began operation under the new name Bastian Solutions. The final major change to the company occurred 
                  in 2017 when Bastian Solutions was acquired by Toyota Advanced Logistics. Currently, Bastian Solutions has offices spread throughout Canada, 
                  the United States, and Mexico and operates with the main goal of providing clients a competitive advantage by designing and delivering world-
                  class distribution and production solutions.

                <h3>Job Description</h3>
                <p class="content-text">
                    This was my second co-op term working at Bastian Solutions. Upon my return, I was able to jump right back in from where I left off on my 
                    previous term and continue working on Project Sapphire with the same core team, Team Bluejay. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to go into 
                    too much detail about the specifics of Project Sapphire beyond what its core purpose is. Fundamentally, the project is an emulation engine 
                    that models the flow of materials through warehouses. 
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    Compared to my last term, my role as a software developer for Team Bluejay this time around was simultaneously fairly similar, but also different. 
                    The majority of my work was still done using C# and the .Net framework, with Visual Studio as my primary code editor. This term was similar to my 
                    last term in that I was able to work on multiple different pieces of the project, got exposure to different technologies and skills, and the overarching
                    goal was still the same: build an amazing emulation engine. However, the work that I was doing this time around was more complex, required a lot more planning/designing, 
                    and was a lot more critical to the success of the project.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    My first main task early on in the term was to work alongside one of the other co-ops and improve our metrics gathering system. Funny enough, the last 
                    piece of work that I did before I left on my last term was getting in the foundation for the metrics system. Originally, it was a very simple system that 
                    used a single record type and a local LiteDB database for storage. So, it was amazing to come back and see how much the system had improved in just 4 months, 
                    taking advantage of multiple different record types for storage, and using an actual Mongo database for non-local storage capabilities. In terms of my task, 
                    I was asked to implement functionality that allowed the system to display how the number of loads changed over time in every area of a facility. This involved 
                    writing backend logic in C# to gather the required information and using MudBlazor with an ApexCharts library to display the information on our GUI. 
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    Most of my work throughout the term actually involved multiple different aspects of software development. For many of my tasks, I was able to improve multiple 
                    different software development skills at once. This list consisted of: algorithm design, GUI design, backend development, and frontend development. Thus, I am 
                    extremely grateful that a single role exposed me to all of these different areas of software development.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    In terms of the middle of my co-op term, my work mainly centered around improvements and tools that were either specifically requested by higher-ups in the company
                    or were discovered to be a necessity by our own team. For example, one of the tools that was requested by a higher-up was the ability to see utilization information 
                    for each area of a facility. In our system, a facility was modeled and stored using a tree structure. Previously, utilization information was only shown for the lowest 
                    levels in the tree (ie. the most specific level). However, with this change, I was able to show the utilization information for every level of the tree. This made it easy 
                    to see at a glance how much (in terms of a percentage) higher level areas in the facility (or even the facility as a whole) were being utilized. Additionally, a tool that 
                    I developed that was requested by someone on our team was a script that pulled out and displayed length, speed, and traversal time information for segments in the facility 
                    structure. This tool allowed users to easily search for specific segment information by using the name of the component that the segments belong to as an argument. The tool 
                    also gave users the choice to retrieve information about every single segment in a given facility. This script actually ended up being very useful and I found myself running 
                    it at least once or twice each week to give the requested information to one of my team members.  
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    Finally, towards the end of my term, I was tasked with working on a brand new project. Essentially, the project was a GUI tool that allowed users to configure a bay/rack component 
                    for a warehouse. The main inspiration behind this was based on the fact that a bay is a fairly complex structure that requires a lot of different input to be defined accurately. 
                    Therefore, the concern for the team was that configuring a bay through configuration files or through code would be very complex. However, allowing users to do it through a GUI would 
                    simplify things drastically. Since this was a brand new idea, I was given the opportunity to design everything from scratch. This meant designing the overall class structure and designing 
                    the look of the GUI in Figma. The next step was implementing the backend class system and the various verification and/or calculation logic. The final step in the process was to implement the 
                    frontend GUI and input gathering, which was all done using MudBlazor.

                      <h5> LITERACY - Technological Literacy </h5>
                      My first goal for this work term was to gain experience with and understand the use cases of the ELK Stack. The ELK stack is a 
                      fairly commonly used stack in modern software companies. Gaining first hand experience with the stack, understanding its capabilities, 
                      and understanding how to use it will make me a more well-rounded developer and will help me during future employment opportunities. After 
                      using the ELK stack throughout the work term, my knowledge level (in terms of knowing how to use the stack and what it does) has definitely 
                      improved. During my work term, the team made a core change that included the migration of the ELK stack into our project. As a result, I 
                      was able to gain first hand experience with both setting up Elasticsearch and Kibana from scratch. Additionally, I was given the opportunity 
                      to see the power of the stack by using existing Kibana dashboards and creating a brand new one. While I was not able to dive into the more 
                      advanced features of the stack, this work term gave me an understanding of the basics of the ELK stack.

                    <h5>COMMUNICATING - Oral Communication</h5>
                    My second goal of the work term was to Improve my ability to verbally explain the tasks that I am working on and what the code that I have written does. 
                    Throughout my career, it is highly likely that I will be interacting with people who do not have a programming background. In these situations, it is critical 
                    that I am able to explain what is going on regardless of the personâ€™s familiarity with programming. Also, in general, being able to effectively explain what 
                    certain pieces of code are doing is a very important skill for a developer to have. After 4 months of daily stand-ups, weekly demos, design meetings, and sprint 
                    review/planning meetings, I can say with confidence that my oral communication skills have improved greatly. Firstly, our daily stand-ups allowed me to practice 
                    verbally explaining the tasks that I am working on and how any of my implemented changes work. Additionally, weekly team demos and sprint review/planning meetings 
                    drastically improved my ability to highlight and explain different pieces of actual code and how they work. Finally, near the end of my term, I was given the opportunity 
                    to demo my work for my bossâ€™ boss. This was an exciting opportunity as I was able to present the work that I had completed throughout the term to a higher-up at the company. 
                    As a result, I gained experience with demoing and explaining my work/code in a more formal environment (compared to the much more informal weekly team demos). Overall, this term 
                    gave me constant chances to work on my oral communication skills and as a result, they have improved significantly.

                    <h5>LITERACY - Technological Literacy </h5>
                    My last goal for this work term was to improve my ability to use the Visual Studio IDE. Visual Studio is a very popular and standard IDE that is used in a lot of different
                     software companies. Being able to efficiently use the IDE for development and debugging purposes will allow me to complete work faster, figure out bugs faster, and make me a
                      better developer overall. Therefore, completing this goal will improve my employability for future opportunities. After using the Visual Studio IDE pretty much everyday for 
                      4 months, I think that it is safe to say that I have achieved this goal. As time went on, I began to learn small shortcuts and commands that allowed me to improve my efficiency. 
                      Additionally, I think that my ability to debug has improved greatly. Previously, my debugging methods mainly consisted of using print statements before and after blocks of code to 
                      help narrow down the issue. However, throughout the term, I became much more comfortable with using the Visual Studio debug mode. For example, I learned how to effectively use breakpoints 
                      and step over/into code blocks to help figure out the problem. Additionally, I became comfortable with using the call stack view and inspecting variables to help aid in fixing the issue. 
                      Therefore, my ability to use the Visual Studio IDE has improved significantly over the course of the term, thus greatly improving my ability to code and debug efficiently and effectively.

                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p class="content-text">
                    Once again, after just four months of working at Bastian Solutions, I feel as though my skills as a developer have improved incredibly. Additionally, with consistent team meetings and tight deadlines, 
                    I had to constantly use my communication and time-management skills in order to be a productive member of the team. Therefore, while my development skills improved greatly, so too did my general soft skills. 
                    One thing that I specifically wanted to mention was how grateful I am for the opportunity to be able to see a product come to life before my very own eyes. Since I started working with the team while they were 
                    still very early in the product development process, I was able to see the product go from being just an idea to a fully functioning product. I feel as though that this is not usually the case for most co-op students 
                    and I just wanted to express how unique and engaging the experience has been.
